Description: This 'ggplot2' extension provides visualization utilities for simplex 
    representations.
    The underlying barycentric coordinate representation 
    offers a canonical visualization technique for various quantities of
    interest. The main intended use case for this package are Posterior
    Model Probabilities.
    The package is currently under active development and highly experimental.
